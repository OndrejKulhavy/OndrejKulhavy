# 👋 Hello! I'm Ondřej Kulhavý

I am a Czech 🇨🇿 software development student in my first year of a bachelor's degree at [Atlantic Technological University, Sligo](https://www.itsligo.ie/) in Ireland 🇮🇪. I previously studied at [Střední průmyslová škola elektrotechnická, Ječná](https://www.spsejecna.cz/) in the Czech Republic. Currently, I'm working on an AR app for surgical planning as part of a research project called VRLab by the [Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine](https://www.ikem.cz/en/) 🏥.
