# 👋 Hi, I'm Ondřej Kulhavý 🇨🇿 🇪🇺
A first-year **Software Development** student at [Atlantic Technological University, Sligo](https://www.itsligo.ie/) in Ireland 🇮🇪, originally from the Czech Republic 🇨🇿. Before starting university, I studied at [Střední průmyslová škola elektrotechnická, Ječná](https://www.spsejecna.cz/). Currently, I’m involved in an exciting **AR app** development for **surgical planning** as part of the **VRLab** research project at the [Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine](https://www.ikem.cz/en/) 🏥.

  A web platform for managing patient 3D model data across healthcare institutions. It integrates VR/AR devices, supports API-driven data exchange, and features an intuitive UI.  
  **Technologies**: Django, Docker, React, ShadcnUI  

- **AR Lab**  
  An **Augmented Reality** solution for surgical planning, developed for the [Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine](https://www.ikem.cz/en/).
