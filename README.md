### I’m currently working on...
- Android app called [**Obec v Kapse**](https://github.com/OndrejKulhavy/Obec-v-Kapse), which shows you events in your :czech_republic: city/village. App is based on open data from [NKOD](https://data.gov.cz/). 
     - I also created some [sample data](https://github.com/OndrejKulhavy/OvK_OFN_datasets) that you can use for your similar project.
- Website for *Studentský Parlament Ječná* in my school.
